# Extremify?
Regarding the reproducibility problem described in my previous entry:

Let's consider an extreme solution. All work must be replicated before publication by more than three independent researchers. Tables and metrics must be exactly verified, and all implementation instructions or code must be provided by the paper. Besides the additional effort on the part of the journal to carry out this procedure, by the end, the reviewer has done nearly as much work as the primary investigator. Further, for large projects with multiple authors, it is nearly impossible to task one person on replicating the entire paper. While the solution solves the reproducibility crisis, the burden on the reviewer is too large to surmount. 

On the other hand, let's consider an extreme version of the problem. What if the researcher directly made up information? Could this go undetected? At the moment, there is no such reproducibility verification, so hypothetically, a researcher could get away with making up entire tables of data. 

Considering these extremes, it seems like the best overall solution is for journals to require code to be shared along with published work. This guarantees some amount of reproducibility as reviewers should be able to immediately run code and see results, but at the same time, it does not force all reviewers to spend exorbitant amounts of time for verification.
