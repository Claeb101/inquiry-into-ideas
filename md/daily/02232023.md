# Challenge: Be A Skeptic
Regarding the reproducibility problem described in my previous entry:

But, how do we know that the reproducibility crisis even exists? Perhaps the real issue is that academic papers need a more thorough format. Before preemptively blaming academic dishonesty, maybe the stigma of verbose research writing dilutes the implementation details that are needed to increase reproducibility. 

How is this a pertinent issue for the larger academic audience? If a journal wants to publish quality work, they are free to mandate peer-review or reproducibility rules. However, if no such rules are in place, why is it the responsibility of the researcher to produce reproducible work if that is not the requirement?

Of course, as with any academic pursuit, dishonest people exist, but it is entirely inappropriate to call this matter a crisis, or even an issue.
