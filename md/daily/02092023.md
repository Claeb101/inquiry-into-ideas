# Explain It to An Alien
**Problem:** How do we solve the reproducibility crisis in academic research, specifically in computer science?

Dear Alien,

Imagine you make a discovery. You find a rock. The rock is shiny, heavy, and glows in the dark. So what do you do? You tell your friends, of course. You tell them that you saw a rock. It was shiny, heavy, and glowed in the dark. Your friends ask to see the rock, and that's when you realize that you dropped it on your way to see them. Should you be trusted? How do your friends know that you never lied?

This problem is a real-world analogue to the reproducibility crisis in academic research. A researcher makes a potentially flawed yet groundbreaking discovery, but their documentation of their process is inadequate. Nobody is able to rediscover it, so are they lying or not? More importantly, how can we research further if the works that inspire us could be inherently flawed? 

Let me know if you have any advice, Mr. Alien. 

Your human friend,\
Caleb
