Perhaps the real issue is that academic papers need a more thorough format. Before preemptively blaming academic dishonesty, maybe the stigma of verbose research writing dilutes the implementation details that are needed to increase reproducibility. \n\nHow is this a pertinent issue for the larger academic audience? If a journal wants to publish quality work, they are free to mandate peer-review or reproducibility rules. However, if no such rules are in place, why is it the responsibility of the researcher to produce reproducible work if that is not the requirement?\n\nOf course, as with any academic pursuit, dishonest people exist, but it is entirely inappropriate to call this matter a crisis, or even an issue.\n"}, {"path": "02092023.md", "date": "02/09/2023", "data": "# Explain It to An Alien\n**Problem:** How do we solve the reproducibility crisis in academic research, specifically in computer science?\n\nDear Alien,\n\nImagine you make a discovery. You find a rock. The rock is shiny, heavy, and glows in the dark. So what do you do? You tell your friends, of course. You tell them that you saw a rock. It was shiny, heavy, and glowed in the dark. Your friends ask to see the rock, and that's when you realize that you dropped it on your way to see them. Should you be trusted? How do your friends know that you never lied?\n\nThis problem is a real-world analogue to the reproducibility crisis in academic research. A researcher makes a potentially flawed yet groundbreaking discovery, but their documentation of their process is inadequate. Nobody is able to rediscover it, so are they lying or not? More importantly, how can we research further if the works that inspire us could be inherently flawed? \n\nLet me know if you have any advice, Mr. Alien. \n\nYour human friend,\\\nCaleb\n\n"}, {"path": "02022023.md", "date": "02/02/2023", "data": "# Is that so?\nAt first, Hakuin seems devoid of emotion, responding \"Is that so?\" both to the accusation and request for forgiveness.
